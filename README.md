## The world’s fastest Postgres for analytics

Hydra is a modern, open source replacement for enterprise data warehouses. It’s fast and feature-rich so devs can build better analytics, quicker.

Hydra implements an open source columnar engine to Postgres, driving 23X query performance, better cache hit rates, and scalability over basic Postgres. When comparing to traditional warehouses, Hydra delivers 1500X more throughput to enable realtime analytical workloads.

[Review Clickbench](https://tinyurl.com/clickbench) for comprehensive results and the list of 42 queries tested.

This benchmark represents typical workload in the following areas: clickstream and traffic analysis, web analytics, machine-generated data, structured logs, and events data. It covers the typical queries in ad-hoc analytics and real-time dashboards.

## 🚀 Quick Start
### Run Hydra locally

The Hydra [Docker image](https://github.com/hydradatabase/hydra/pkgs/container/hydra) is a drop-in replacement for [postgres Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres).

You can also try out Hydra locally using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```
git clone https://github.com/hydradatabase/hydra && cd hydra
cp .env.example .env
docker compose up
psql postgres://postgres:hydra@127.0.0.1:5432
```

### Use Hydra Cloud

Hydra Cloud is the fastest and most reliable way to run Hydra. It is a cloud-based data warehouse that allows you to consolidate data from various sources into a single, unified system. It provides a user-friendly interface for automated data ingestion and transformation.

Hydra Cloud provides a scalable and secure cloud environment where automatic backups, resource scaling, high availability, point-in-time recovery, and more is available instantly with new databases.
